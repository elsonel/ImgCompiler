## Getting Started

#### Setup

* Put image frames into /input
* Ensure image frames have transparent backgrounds and are named following the format: 0001.png, 0002.png...
* Adjust the following constants:
```
int STARTFRAME = 1;        //Frame stats at 0001.png
int ENDFRAME = 87;         //Frame ends at 0020.png
int DENSITY = 4;           //Trail density
float TRANSPARENCY = 0.3;  //Trail transparency
```

#### Executing program

* Run application in Processing IDE.
* Collect processed frames in /output dictionary.

## Issues

If the program crashes due to limited memory, process input frames in chunks by adjusting the STARTFRAME and ENDFRAME variables.
